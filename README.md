# House Pointer (C++)

## Introduction

Welcome to the "House Pointer (C++)" project! This project represents a beginner's exploration of the pointer feature in C++. The focus is on understanding how pointers work in C++ and their application in a simple program.

## About the Project

This project revolves around a basic C++ program that models a house and calculates its price based on certain attributes. The program demonstrates two different methods of passing the house details to a function for price calculation: passing by value and passing by reference using pointers.

## Key Features

- **House Structure**: The project defines a House structure with attributes such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms.
- **Calculation Functions**: Two functions are implemented to calculate the price of a house. One function accepts the house object by value, simulating the traditional approach of copying the house details for appraisal. The other function accepts a pointer to the house, mimicking the appraiser going to the location of the house for appraisal.
- **Pointer Exploration**: The project serves as an introductory exploration into the usage of pointers in C++.

## Getting Started

- **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/markheramis/HousePointer-Cpp.git
    ```
- **Compile and Run**: Use a C++ compiler to build the program and run the executable. For example:

    ```
    g++ main.cpp -o HousePointer
    ./HousePointer
    ```

- **Explore the Code**: Dive into the code to understand the implementation details and the role of pointers in the program.
